# Element - Embeddings

## CGCNN

The following paper describes the details of the CGCNN framework, information about how the one-hot atom embedding was constructed is available in the supplementary materials:

## MEGnet

The following paper describes the details of the MEGnet framework, the embedding is generated from the atomic weights through one MEGnet layer on a training task to predict the computed formation energies of âˆ¼69,000 materials from the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/) Database:

## MatScholar

This is an experimental NLP embedding based on the data mining of definite compositions and structure prototypes.

## One-hot

This is a simple one-hot encoding for the elements
