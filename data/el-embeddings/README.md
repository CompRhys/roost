# Element - Embeddings

## CGCNN

The following paper describes the details of the CGCNN framework, infomation about how the onehot atom embedding was constructed is availiable in the supplementary materials:

[Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.145301)

## MEGnet

The following paper describes the details of the MEGnet framework, the embedding is generated from the atomic weights through one MEGnet layer on a training task to predict the computed formation energies of ∼69,000 materials from the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/) Database:

[Graph Networks as a Universal Machine Learning Framework for Molecules and Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05055)

## MatScholar

This is an experimental NLP embedding based on the data mining of definite compositions and structure prototypes.

[Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1335-8)

## Onehot

This is a simple one-hot encoding for the elements

## Elem

These a selection of normalised atomic properties collated from various sources.
