## NOTE

Development is going to slowly be moved from this repository to the https://github.com/CompRhys/aviary repository. This repository will be restored to allow the paper results to be directly replicated and pre-trained models used in the paper will be shared to make it as easy as possible to replicate. This is to attempt to ensure that Roost hopefully becomes easier to use after I finish my PhD.

## Premise

In materials discovery applications often we know the composition of trial materials but have little knowledge about the structure.

Many current SOTA results within the field of machine learning for materials discovery are reliant on knowledge of the structure of the material. This means that such models can only be applied to systems that have undergone structural characterisation. As structural characterisation is a time-consuming process whether done experimentally or via the use of ab-initio methods the use of structures as our model inputs is a prohibitive bottleneck to many materials screening applications we would like to pursue.

One approach for avoiding the structure bottleneck is to develop models that learn from the stoichiometry alone. In this work, we show that via a novel recasting of how we view the stoichiometry of a material we can leverage a message-passing neural network to learn materials properties whilst remaining agnostic to the structure. The proposed model exhibits increased sample efficiency compared to more widely used descriptor-based approaches. This work draws inspiration from recent progress in using graph-based methods for the study of small molecules and crystalline materials.

## Environment Setup

To use `roost` you need to create an environment with the correct dependencies. The easiest way to get up and running it to use `Anaconda`.
A `cudatoolkit=11.1` environment file is provided `environment-gpu-cu111.yml` allowing a working environment to be created with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-gpu-cu111.yml
```

If you are not using `cudatoolkit=11.1` or do not have access to a GPU this setup will not work for you. If so please check the following pages [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), [PyTorch-Scatter](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) for how install the core packages and then install the remaining requirements as detailed in `requirements.txt`.

The was developed and tested on Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa. The code should work on with other Operating Systems but it has not been tested for such use.

## Roost Setup

Once you have setup an environment with the correct dependencies you can install `roost` using the following commands:

```bash
conda activate roost
git clone https://github.com/CompRhys/roost
cd roost
python setup.py sdist
pip install -e .
```

This will install the library in an editable state allowing for advanced users to make changes as desired.

## Example Use

In order to test your installation you can do so by running the following example from the top of your `roost` directory:

```sh
cd /path/to/roost/
python examples/roost-example.py --train --evaluate --epochs 10 --tasks regression --targets Eg --losses L2
```

This command runs a default task for 10 epochs -- experimental band gap regression using the data from Zhou et al. (See `data/` folder for reference). This default task has been set up to work out of the box without any changes and to give a flavour of how the model can be used. The demo task should take less than a minute when a GPU is available are give a test set MAE of 0.42-0.45 eV after 10 epochs.

If you want to use your own data set on a regression task this can be done with:

```sh
python examples/roost-example.py --data-path /path/to/your/data/data.csv --train --tasks [regression/classification, ...] --targets [<header from csv>, ..] --losses [L1/L2, ..]
```

You can then test your model with:

```sh
python examples/roost-example.py --test-path /path/to/testset.csv --evaluate --tasks [regression/classification, ...] --targets [<header from csv>, ..] --losses [L1/L2, ..]
```

The model takes input in the form csv files with materials-ids, composition strings and target values as the columns.

| material-id | composition | target |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| foo-1       | Fe2O3       | 2.3    |
| foo-2       | La2CuO4     | 4.3    |

Basic hints about more advanced use of the model (i.e. classification, robust losses, ensembles, tensorboard logging etc..)
are available via the command:

```sh
python examples/roost-example.py --help
```

This will output the various command-line flags that can be used to control the code.
